Pull requests are encouraged.

Please follow the following guidelines:

- Add at least a test to `examples/passing/` and possibly to `examples/failing`.
- Build the binaries and libs with `cabal build`
- Install the binaries and libs with `cabal install`.
- Run `cabal test` to build the test suite.
- Run `./execTests.sh` to execute the test suite.
- Please run `hlint`.

If you would like to contribute, please consider the issues in the current milestone first.

Send me (`paf31`) a message if you have any implementation questions, I'm more than happy to talk about the design, and I'm more than willing to redesign parts if necessary.

Finally, if you have made code changes and would like to be included in the copyright notice in the cabal file, please include that change in your pull request.
